# b3view
View B3D files (and possibly other files supported by Irrlicht).

This is a modernized fork by poikilos (see CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation
* Open .pro file in Qt Creator
* Build & Run (if you have trouble compiling, see
  [filehandoff#compiling-issues](https://github.com/poikilos/filehandoff#compiling-issues))
* Copy all of the files from `./build` to your actual build directory,
  if your build directory is not `./build`
* Copy your favorite font to `./build/arial.tff` (Arial is not included
  due its proprietary license).

## Usage
* File, Open
* Choose an Irrlicht-compatible B3D file.
